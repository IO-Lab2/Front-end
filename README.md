# Building and Testing
Building and running the project for testing requires having [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed on the system.
Some programs automatically import everything after opening the project, but in case yours doesn't, here are the build instructions.

After downloading the project, in the terminal run:
```shell
npm install
```
while inside the project folder. Node will then handle downloading all the dependencies.

To start the development server for testing, run:
```shell
npm run dev
```
A link will then pop up to view the website in the browser.

The project runs on top of [Vite](https://vite.dev/), which automatically applies all changes to code and assets in real-time,
so refreshing the website shouldn't be necessary.
